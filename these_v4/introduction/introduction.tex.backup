\paragraph{Switched systems}

Switched systems are a sub-class of hybrid systems, extensively used...

CPS...

We are interested in synthesizing controllers for such systems. many approaches have been developed,
some are specific for switched systems, others are more general.

\paragraph{Controller synthesis}

\begin{equation}
 \dot x = A x + B u
\end{equation}


state of the art of switched systems: lyapunov approaches and theoretical approaches,
optimal control through optimization... 
Many results for linear systems. 


Here:  Symbolic control, which uses the computer tool with an automated method for 
(mostly offline) controller synthesis. 
Several approaches as well, available for linear and/or nonlinear systems: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item finite state abstraction by (alternating) approximate bisimulation [PESSOA]
  \item finite state abstraction for monotone systems
 \item $\varepsilon$ bisimulation. [Girard]
  \item Feedback refinement relations. [SCOTS,Reissig,...]
  \item [Sriram]
\end{itemize}

All these approaches present the same drawback, they are all subject to the so called 
{\em curse of dimensionality}, which means that the computational cost of 
the associated algorithms is exponential in the dimension $n$ of the state. 
Approaches looking further in time (sequences of control inputs) add an exponential 
complexity with respect to the number of switching modes and the number 
of time steps considered.
